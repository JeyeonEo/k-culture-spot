    "story1": "This service started from a trip to Fukui, Japan, where we went with friends to see Maeda Riku from NCT WISH.",
    "highlight": "\"We wanted to follow in our favorite artist's footsteps, but the information was so fragmented.\"",
    "story2": "Gathering scattered information from everywhere was really exhausting. SNS, blogs, fan cafes... There was plenty of information, but nowhere to find it all in one place.",
    "story3": "That's when we thought: Let's create a service where all fans can easily find pilgrimage information. And that's how HypeSpot was born.",
